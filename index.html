            Computer Programs
            Computer Science is how to solve problems, by breaking them into smaller pieces and making a procedure for the computer.
            Programming is the core of computer science.

            Programming Tips
        </div>
        <div class = "tips" >
            Computer:
            Designed to do anything, universal machine, it can do any program.
            Program:
            Tells computer what to do
            I is a series of instructions
            Use precise sequence of steps
            Computation (use rules of 3, convert units and consider Hz)
            High-level language:
            Python
            Instead of running on computer , it runs on interpreter

            Inputs and Outputs
        </div>
        <div class = "definition" >
            Inputs are all the data that we are getting into our system
        </div>
        <div class = "definition" >
            Outputs are all the data that we pretend to get out of our system
        </div>
        <div class = "definition" >
         The system si the series of procedures we make to turn the input into the output
        </div>
        <div class = "title" >
            Functions
            DEFINITON:
            What is a function?
            A function is a series of procedures within our program that will (intendedly) be used more than once.
            The purpose of programming is to avoid repetition, with Functions, we can use the same procedure several times without repeating code.
        </div>
        <div class = "definition" >
            How to make a function?
            in python we use: 
            def function(input):
                pass
                return output
        </div>
        <div class = "definition" >
            When you should write a function?
            Whenever we need to repeat a procedure.
            DEFINTITION:Why are functions so valuable.
            They will help us to reduce our programming time, they avoid code repetition.

        <div class = "title" >
            Loops
        </div>
        <div class = "definition" >
            Loops help us repeat procedures. Useful for iterative purposes.

            Procedural Thinking
        </div>
        <div class = "definition" >
             Procedural Thinking consists on thinking the steps to take to convert our input into output.
            We should always reduce the problems, and think of them as small problems to be joined in the whole.

            Lists
        </div>
        <div class = "definition" >
            The list is a most versatile datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Important thing about a list is that items in a list need not be of the same type.

            Rules of Problems
        </div>
        <div class = "tips" >
        0. Donâ€™t Panic
        1. What are the Inputs
        2. What are the outputs?
        3. Solve the problem
        Defensive Programing, avoid errors checking in code
