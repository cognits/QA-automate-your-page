					The web is a giant network of computers that talk to each other using a protocol call HTTP.  A webpage is document written in HTML (HyperTextMarkupLanguage). A web browser is a program that interprets and displays the info.  The main pieces of the web are: users, the net and servers.

				<p>
					Examples of <span class="italic">Inline</span> elements: a, span, br, img and strong.

				</p>
				<p>
					5 different types of thinking:
					<ol>
						<li>Procedural - Creating clear and unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow</li>
						<li>Abstract - Finding similiarity, or generality, amongst seemingly different things (avoiding repetition)</li>
						<li>Systematic - Breaking a big problem down into smaller pieces (big-picture and decision-making) and how the pieces fit together</li>
						<li>Technological Empathy - Understanding how a computer works, what it is, and what it's good and bad at doing (understanding tools)</li>	
						<li>Debugging - Systematic process of identifying the cause of a computer that doesn't work.  If a program doesn't work, there is a mistake.</li>
					</ol>
				<p>
				Here are the steps to fix the problem<br>
				1.  Collect evidence (what makes the program fail?)<br>
				2. Generate theories (what caused this?)<br>
				3. Test theories (if theory is right, how do I find out?<br>

				Avoiding repetition

			<div class="concept-description">
				<p>
					Avoiding mistakes and consistency: <br>
					<br>	
					When doing the same thing over and over it becomes easy to make a mistake.  The benefit of CSS is that it allows you make changes to parts of the document with a few lines of code instead of going through and manually applying the style to each individual line.  For example, with this page, by assinging each lesson and header a class, I'm able to set the style with just one bit of code.  I didn't need to set it each time.  Very, very useful.

			<div class="concept-title">
				What is CSS?
			</div>
			<div class="concept-description">
				<p>
					CSS stands for cascading style sheets.  It is the code that applies the look to the HTML structure.  It cascades throughout the whole document.  Meaning it not only applies to element's that directly match, but element's children as well.  This is inheritance.  If there are multiple rules for a child, the most specific wins.  You link to the CSS file in the head of the html doc.  Put the CSS file and HTML file in the same folder.

				Boxes, boxes, and boxes
			</div>
			<div class="concept-description">
				<p>
					Earlier I mentioned to see everything as boxes in HTML.  This is not only helpful in developing structure but it makes it easier to style.  There are 4 components to the boxes: Margin, border, padding and conent.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because there are four components, sizing can be different.  Also, browser display content differently.  This will be important in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					Display: flex; allows divs to appear next to each other instead of stacked.  Will use this to build a TOC (table of contents)
					that appears next to the conent.  How do I make it stay static while content moves to make navigation easier?
				</p>
				<p>
					Two techniques: 
					<ol>
						<li>use percents instead of pixels</li>
						<li>boxsizing: border-box</li>

					In English, people often make grammatical errors but we still can get at what they mean.  Computers are literal Larry's, meaning they are not intuitive.  If it isn't grammatically correct the code won't run.

		<div class="concept" id="var_string21">
			<div class="concept-title">
				What is a variable in Python?
			</div>
			<div class="concept-description">
				<p>
					Variables are a way to give names to values.  For example:  variable = 2.
				</p>
				<p>
					This example is how you assing a value to a variable.  You can change the value of the variabl later by re-assigning it a diffrerent value.
				</p>
				<p>
					The = sign does not mean the same thing as it does math.  Think of the equals sign as an arrow pointing to the left.
				</p>
				<p>
					Variables are useful in a bunch of ways:
					<ul>
						<li>They improve code readability by using names that make sense</li>
						<li>They allow us to store the value of important data</li>
						<li>They give us the way to change the value of something</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a difference between 2 + 2 and "2" + "2"...  Anything with quotes around it is a string (just a sequence of characters).  2 + 2 would equal 4.  "2" + "2" would be "22".  This is what is called concatenation.  It just means joining two strings together.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can't add a string and an integer but you can multiply a string.

			<div class="concept-title">
				What is the difference between making and using a function?
			</div>
			<div class="concept-description">
				<p>
					First you need to make a function by using a line of code starting with the keyword <b>def</b> then give the function a name followed by the function parameters in parentheses.  The parameters are replaced by actual values when the function is used (called).
				</p>
				<p>
					Then you specify in the "body" of the function the code that specifies what you want to do with the input parameters.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Next, you call the function by using the print statement followed by the name of the function followed by the values you want to input.  Number of inputs needs to match then number of parameters.  The value of the input is assigned of each parameter name in order and then the block is evaluated.

					Debugging is a scientific process of examining code to discover things you didn't expect.  
				</p>
				<p>
					It isn't just correcting errors or learning how mistakes were made.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's unavoidable so its important to develop systems to solve problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					1.  Examine error messages when programs crash.  The last line tells you what wrong.  Read backwards to learn more about the problem.  Google will be your friend.
				</p>
				<p> 
					2.  Work from example code.  If modified code doesn't work, commet it out and do step-by-step modifications.
				</p>
				<p>
					3.  Make sure examples work.  Check to see if runs properly.
				</p>
				<p>
					4.  Check (print) immediate results.  When code doesn't crash, but doesn't do what's intended, use print statements to find out why.
				</p>
				<p>
					5.  Keep and compare old versions.  When you have a working version of code, save it before adding more code.  This gives you something to come back to.
